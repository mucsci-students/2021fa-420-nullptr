<div class="headers">Introduction </div><br>


The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is the default interface for creating a UML diagram.
It is entered by running the program through a terminal and entering localhost:60555 into a web browser.
This text document serves as a user guide to the various features that the UML++ class diagram editor has.
These are 1. the GUI, 2. classes, 3. fields and methods, 4. relationships, 5. saving and loading, and 6. undo and redo.
This text document can be reached by pressing the help button at the top of the Editor Pannel.

<div class="headers">1. The GUI</div><br>
<br>
Upon loading the web browser, you will see the window in which classes are displayed at the right of the screen. 
On the left of the screen is the Editor Pannel through which classes can be created and modified. The Editor Pannel 
can be toggled on and off using the Toggle Editor Pannel button at the top left.

<div class="headers">2. Classes </div><br>
<br>
To create a class, enter the name of the class into the text field in the Editor Pannel and click the Add Class button.
The name of the class can be changed by clicking the Edit button next to the class name. Pressing the Delete button will 
remove the class and all its components.

The name of the class must be valid, that is it must be start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, and underscore
and cannot be the name of an existing class.

After a class is created, it will appear on the right of the screen as a box and in the Editor Pannel. The box can be moved by 
clicking and dragging it with the mouse. The class is modified using the buttons below it in the Editor Pannel.

<div class="headers">3. Fields and Methods </div><br>
<br>
Fields and methods can be added to a class by entering them into the text fields under the class. 

To enter a field, input the field type and name and click Add Field. The name and type of the field can be modified using the 
Edit button next to the field and deleted using the Delete button.

To enter a method, input the method type and name and click Add Method. The name and type of the method can be modified using 
the Edit button next to the field and deleted using the Delete button.

Methods can also contain parameters. Paramters are added by entering the name and type into the text fields under the method 
and clicking Add Parameter. Paramters can also be edited and deleted using the buttons next to the parameter.

The names of Fields, Methods, and Parameters must be valid, so they must start with a letter and contain only letters, numbers, 
and underscore. Additionally, the name for fields and methods must not be the same as an existing field or method. However, 
a method can have the same name as another method as long as the parameters are different. Parameters cannot have the same name
as other parameters in the same method.

All fields and methods are displayed in the display window in the box of the class they are a part of. Parameters are displayed
next to the method they are attatched to.

<div class="headers">4. Relationships </div><br>
<br>
Relations that are added exist between either two classes or a class and itself, and are added using the Relationships portion of the
Editor Panel at the bottom.

To add a relationship, enter the name of the class that is the source inot the Source text field, and the name of the class that is the
destination into the Destination text field. Next, choose the type of relationship from the drop down menu and click add relationship.

Invalid relationships are a class can only the the destination for one composition. And for generalization and realizations a class cannot
be the same source and destination.

When the relationship is added, it is displayed in the Editor Pannel with the source pointint to the destination. The relationship can be
edited and deleted using the respective buttons. In the display window, the relationship is shown using a line from one class to the other.

<br>
To save the current UML Diagram, enter the name of the file at the bottom of the Editor Pannel in the text field next to the Save button 
and press the button. Valid names are standard operating system file names. Entering the name of an existing file will overwrite the file.

To load a UML Diagram from a file, enter the name of the file into the second text field and press the load button.

Files are saved and loaded in the same directory as the program.
