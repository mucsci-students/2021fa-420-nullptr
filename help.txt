UML++ serves as an editor for an implementation of a UML class diagram.

The program's command interface is operated by inputting numbers into the 
console that correspond to a given command. For example, to go through
operations for Class, input a 0 and press Enter to enter it.

UML++ has the following hierarchy for its command-line interface:

- [0] Class: Lists operations for modifying classes.
    - [0] Add: Prompts for a class name. If the class does not already exist
               and is valid, the class will be inserted into the diagram.
    - [1] Remove: Prompts for a class name. If the class exists, the class will
                  be removed from the UML class diagram.
    - [2] Rename: Prompts for a class name. If the class exists and the new 
                  name is valid, the class will have its name modified to the
                  new name prompted.
    - [3] Back: Returns back to the main set of commands.
    
- [1] Attribute: Lists operations for modifying attributes.
    - [0] Add: Prompts for a class and an attribute name. If the class exists
               and the attribute does not already exist in the class and is 
               valid, it will be inserted into the class.
    - [1] Remove: Prompts for a class and an attribute name. If the class 
                  exists alongside the attribute, the attribute will be 
                  removed.
    - [2] Rename: Prompts for a class and an attribute name. If the class 
                  exists alongside the attribute, and the attribute name is 
                  valid, the attribute will be renamed.
    - [3] Back: Returns back to the main set of commands.
    
- [2] Relationship: Lists operations for modifying relationships.
    - [0] Add: Prompts for a source class and a destination class. If both 
               classes exist and the relationship doesn't already exist, a new
               relationship is made.
    - [1] Remove: Prompts for a source class and a destination class. If the 
                  relationship exists, it will be removed.
    - [2] Back: Returns back to the main set of commands.
    
- [3] List: Lists operations for viewing information within the diagram.
    - [0] Class: Prompts for a class name. If the class exists, information 
                 about the class, its attributes, and its relationships will 
                 be displayed.
    - [1] Diagram: Displays all information for all classes, alongside their 
                   attributes and relationships.
    - [2] Back: Returns back to the main set of commands.
    
- [4] Save: Saves your UML diagram to a JSON file in the same directory as the
            executable.

- [5] Load: Prompts for a directory. If the directory exists, a UML diagram 
            made previously by this program will be loaded for modification.

- [6] Help: Loads this help file into the console.

- [7] Exit: Exits the program. If the UML class diagram is not saved 
            beforehand, data will be lost.
