UML++ serves as an editor for an implementation of a UML class diagram.

This is an alpha of the GUI interface that is currently being implemented. As
such, all features are a work in progress. It uses the inja templating 
interface  as well as cpp-httplib to display a basic editor into your browser. 
This editor opens on one's localhost at port 8080 by default when compiled 
(localhost:8080).

Each feature of the UML class diagram is implemented by inserting text into text 
boxes. You are able to add...

- Classes 
    - Two types of attributes (fields, methods) with types to go alongside them
        - Parameters to methods (with their own types)
    - Relationships between classes 

You can also save using the "File" section. You can either chose a file, or 
select from the drop down based JSON files stored in the folder.
