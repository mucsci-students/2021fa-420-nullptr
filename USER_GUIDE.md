# UML++ User Guide

Welcome to the UML++ user guide! This document provides a rundown on how to use UML++ to generate and modify UML class diagrams.

There are two user interfaces that are available for use in editing class diagrams -- the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command Line Interface). This guilde will describe how to use the features within each interface.

## CLI

The CLI provides a command line interface for those who wish to work with a text-based UML class diagram editor. It can be accessed with the "--cli" argument, as shown above.

### Universal Commands

These commands can be accessed while within any menu.

### Main Commands

These commands can be accessed while within the main menu (uml>)

### Class Commands

These commands can be accessed when the class submenu (class>), or by adding 'class' to the operation while in the main menu (uml> class ...)

### Relationship Commands

These commands can be accessed when the relationships submenu (relationships>), or by adding 'relationships' to the operation while in the main menu (uml> relationships ...)

### Field Commands

These commands can be accessed when the field submenu (field>), or by adding 'field' to the operation while in the main menu (uml> field ...)

### Method Commands (method>)

These commands can be accessed when the method submenu (method>), or by adding 'method' to the operation while in the main menu (uml> method ...)

### Parameter Commands (parameter>)

These commands can be accessed when the parameter submenu (parameter>), by adding 'method' to the operation while in the method submenu (method> parameter ...), or by adding 'method parameter' to the operation while in the main menu (uml> method parameter ...)
